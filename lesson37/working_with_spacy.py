Value versus growth? Sometimes, it’s hard to tell the difference. And sometimes, it may depend on what index you are using.
Is Microsoft a growth or value stock? Most investors would say it’s a growth stock, because it has the traditional characteristics of a growth stock: earnings are growing.
But Microsoft is now being classified as partly a growth stock by Standard & Poors, and partly a value stock.
What about Meta? It too was considered a classic growth stock. Not anymore. S&P now says it is 100% a value stock.
Is ExxonMobil a growth or value stock? It has for some time been associated with value, which has been associated with companies that paid high dividends, had a lower P/E ratio and usually a lower price to book ratio. But ExxonMobil is now 100% classified as a growth stock by S&P.
And not just Exxon: Chevon, ConocoPhillips, Williams, Coterra Energy, Marathon Oil, and EQT (all energy stocks) are now considered pure growth stocks.
