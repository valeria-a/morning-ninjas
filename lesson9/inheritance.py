# A3 - 5

# this code will not work for January and February
# this line is incorrect:
# if month == 12 and 1 and 2:

# A3 - 7

# YOu kind of missed the point of the exercise
# if you insert a date at February of leap year, you suppose
# to print that the amount of days is 29

# For example, below output is incorrect:
# enter day:20
# enter month:2
# enter year:2000
# 28 days
# leap year

# You were supposed to print "29 days"

# A3 - 9
# The calculations are incorrect
# For example, if you buy 6 history books, your total calculation should include the fact that
# you don't pay for 2 books in this case
# You get 10% off science books only if you buy 3 or more (there is a condition,
# which you don't check), etc.
# Please review the solution

# A3 - 10

# Incorrect implementation
# For example:

# insert what you what to convert:kb
# into what unit you want to convert:gb
# what amount you want to convert:2

# does not return anything
# the nesting of "if"s is incorrect
# please review the solution
